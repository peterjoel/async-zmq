//! # Async version for ZeroMQ bindings
//!
//! This is high-level bindings for [`zmq`] in asynchronous manner. Crate itself uses some modules from
//! [`async-std`], but it should also work on any other async reactor. The goal for this project
//! is providing simple interface that is compatible with any async executor and reactor.
//!
//! ## TODO list
//!
//! - [ ] PAIR
//! - [x] PUB
//! - [x] SUB
//! - [ ] REQ
//! - [ ] REP
//! - [ ] DEALER
//! - [ ] ROUTER
//! - [ ] PULL
//! - [ ] PUSH
//! - [ ] XPUB
//! - [ ] XSUB
//! - [ ] STREAM
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Users could simply initialize any socket type with `async_zmq::*` in mind, and then call
//! `bind()` or `connect` depends on your scenario. For example, if someone wants a publish socket,
//! then he could initialize the socket like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let zmq = async_zmq::publish("tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")?.bind();
//! ```
//!
//! To learn more about each socket type usage. See [modules](#modules) below.
//!
//! ### Prelude
//!
//! Prelude module provides some common types, traits and their methods. This crate also re-export
//! so it can be easier for you to import them.
//!
